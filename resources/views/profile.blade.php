 Who Am I?
Hi, I am Akon.an IT student who is learning, exploring, and coding her way into the tech world. 
I am passionate about web development,cybersecurity,software Engineering and building projects that make me fall in love with technology even more every day.
When I am not coding, you will probably find me listening to music, laughing with friends, or chasing my glow-up goals like working out.
This profile page is just a little introduction,but trust me there is a lot more to discover.
