  <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I am <strong>Akon</strong>, an IT student who is learning, exploring, and coding her way into the tech world.  
    I am passionate about <em>web development, cybersecurity, software engineering</em> and building projects that make me fall in love with technology even more every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I am not coding, you will probably find me listening to music, laughing with friends, or chasing my glow-up goals like working out.  
    This profile page is just a little introduction, but trust me, there is a lot more to discover.
  </p>
